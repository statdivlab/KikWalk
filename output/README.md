Data products containing the walks of the mammoth are large files, ranging from ~500 Mb to ~5 Gb. Please contact [Amy Willis](http://statisticaldiversitylab.com) if you would like access to them. In your email, please detail your preferences on how you would like to receive the files (e.g., via a Dropbox or Google Drive folder).

Note that you can generate the walks using the scripts contained in `../R/` and data contained in `../data/`.
